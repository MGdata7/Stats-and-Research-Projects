In this project, I will conduct A/B Testing in R Studio to inform data-driven decisions in a home decor company's marketing strategy.

What this means is - I will help a company conduct an experiment and try two different strategies to pushing sales on their app. Instead of releasing it to **all** their user base, they're asking me, the data scientist, to select two smaller samples within their customer base to see how the customers respond to these new marketing notifications. I'm creating a business-safe test run for them to decide how they want to approach their greater user base. If things go well, sales will increase. If things go poorly, users will uninstall the app and they'll lose return business. A mix of both is acceptable as long as it's the correct ratio. I will be the company's guide in picking their strategy.

> Decco is an online retailer that sells home decor items. They recently added "Lamps" as a new category of products. In order to generate awareness and boost sales, they want to launch a promotional campaign through their mobile app. Their notifications have had good success in the past and they are considering a 10 euro discount if users click through to the in-app notification. At the same time, they want to be judicious about any features or releases when it comes to their app because they know that the customer lifetime value of people who have installed the app is much higher. Their goal is to drive lamp sales without causing users to uninstall the app.
